# Geospatial modeling and fabrication

<p align="center"><img src="images/yosemite_sq.png" height="500"></p>

This course is an introduction to digital design for landscape architects.
In this course you will develop a creative digital design process
seamlessly integrating research and design
using geographic information systems (GIS),
3D modeling and rendering, and
visual programming.
You will learn how to use geospatial data
to model and analyze landscapes
and visual programming to
parametrically model and transform new landforms.
You will learn how to model plants - from trees to grasses - in 3D,
automatically distribute them across your digital landscape,
and render photorealistic scenes.
Through a series of 3D modeling projects you will
design the restoration of a highly eroded landscape with a deep gully.
Each week you will spend a day in a workshop
learning new methods
and a day developing your projects.
You will work in small teams and present an exhibition of your
models and renderings at the end of the course.
