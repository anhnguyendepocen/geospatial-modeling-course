# Projects
The study landscape is a highly eroded watershed
feeding into Patterson Branch Creek in Fort Bragg, North Carolina.
This geomorphologically active watershed has deep gullies and
extensive areas of bare, exposed soils.
The creeks, streams, and rivers in this region are critical habitat
for endangered species of mussels.
Mussels, however, require stable stream habitat
and these actively eroding watersheds with sandy-loam soils
cause high sediment bed loads in streams and shifting streambeds.
The aim of this project is to restore the degraded watershed
and reduce sediment transport  
in order to enhance downstream mussel habitat.

## Geospatial modeling project
In order to understand the physical patterns and processes
that shape and change this landscape,
you will use lidar data to
model and digitally fabricate the topography,
analyze topographic parameters,
and simulate water and sediment flows.

In **groups of 5** complete the following assignments by **09/26**.
On 09/28 you will pin-up your work for a critique.
Upload digital copies of your work to the class network drive
at `\\desn-knox.lsu.edu\Landscape-Classes` on Windows
or `smb://desn-knox.lsu.edu/Landscape-Classes` on Mac.
Upload your GRASS mapsets, finished maps, perspectives, animations,
drawing for laser cutting, photos of your laser cut model,
and screenshots for the tutorials.

### Laser cut model
* Material: chipboard, museum board, or basswood (1/16" thick)
* Dimensions: 18"x18"
* Contour interval: 1m
* Hollow

### Tutorial
Complete the following sections of the tutorials on the course website.
Take screenshots to illustrate key steps in the tutorials.
* Screenshots for [Topographic analysis in GRASS GIS](README.md#topographic-analysis-in-grass-gis)
* Screenshots for [Hydrological modeling](README.md#hydrological-modeling)
* Screenshots for [Hydrological simulation](README.md#hydrological-simulation)

### Maps
Design 5 *beautiful* maps, perspectives, and/or animations
for our study landscape
using GRASS GIS and optionally Rhino
The maps should address topics covered in the
[terrain modeling](README.md#terrain-modeling)
and [hydrological modeling](README.md#hydrological-modeling)
modules of this course.
Include cartographic elements like legends, labels, scale bars, north arrows,
and cartographic grids.
Impress me with you cartography, graphic skills, style, and creativity.
* 5 maps about [terrain modeling](README.md#terrain-modeling)
and [hydrological modeling](README.md#hydrological-modeling)
* Layout and print all 5 maps on a 36"x72" plot
* Submit digital and print versions

## Ecosystem modeling project
In **groups of 3** you will
map the existing vegetation
using automated image classification.
Then you will design, model, and render in 3D
a planting plan to restore this degraded landscape.
You will produce beautiful, photorealistic 3D renderings  
of the existing landscape and your design.

### 3D ecosystem library
Develop a list of plants for the study landscape,
organize the plants by community,
find the species or proxies for them in the Xfrog libary,
and prepare 3D models for these species in Blender.
* Spreadsheet with plant communities and species
* Blender library of 3D tree models

### 3D garden
As practice 3D model and 3D render a small garden.
Create particle systems of grass on a small plane.
Add a couple trees and shrubs to scene.
Then 3D render the scene.

### 3D model of existing landscape
Build a terrain model in Blender.
Use image classification in GIS to identify landcover types.
Then use particle systems to automatically populate
the 3D scene with 3D plants based on landcover.
* Blender file with a 3D model of the existing landscape
* 2+ 3D renderings of the existing landscape
* 3D print of existing topography

### 3D model of designed landscape
Develop a design to restore the study landscape
and build a 3D model in Blender of your design.
Include 3D plants, physics-based water,
and optionally elements like 3D stones.
* Blender file with a 3D model of the existing landscape
* 2+ 3D renderings of the designed landscape
* Optional: Blender4Web scene for VR

## Exhibition
As a class you will create an exhibition of your work.
* 3 36"x72" plots with maps analyzing the study landscape
* 3 18"x18" laser cut contour models augmented with projected maps and animations
* 1-2 3D prints
* 3 36"x72" plots with 3D renderings of the restored ecosystem
* Projection or display with 3D renderings and/or animations
* Optional: VR headset with 3D scene
