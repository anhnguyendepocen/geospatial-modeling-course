# Projects


## Geospatial modeling project
In groups of 5 complete the following assignments by **09/26**.
On 09/28 we will setup your work as exhibition and review it.
For the exhibition we will project your maps and animations
over the laser cut models.
Upload digital copies of your work to the class network drive
at `\\desn-knox.lsu.edu\Landscape-Classes` on Windows
or `smb://desn-knox.lsu.edu/Landscape-Classes` on Mac.
Upload your GRASS mapsets, finished maps, perspectives, animations,
drawing for laser cutting, photos of your laser cut model,
and screenshots for the tutorials.

### Laser cut model
* Material: museum board or basswood (1/8" thick)
* Contour interval: 1m
* Hollow

### Tutorial
Complete the following sections of the tutorials on the course website.
Take screenshots to illustrate key steps in the tutorials.
* Screenshots for [Topographic analysis in GRASS GIS](README.md#topographic-analysis-in-grass-gis)
* Screenshots for [Hydrological modeling](README.md#hydrological-modeling)
* Screenshots for [Hydrological simulation](README.md#hydrological-simulation)

### Maps
Design 5 *beautiful* maps, perspectives, and/or animations
for our study landscape
using GRASS GIS and optionally Rhino
The maps should address topics covered in the
[terrain modeling](README.md#terrain-modeling)
and [hydrological modeling](README.md#hydrological-modeling)
modules of this course.
Include cartographic elements like legends, labels, scale bars, north arrows,
and cartographic grids.
Impress me with you cartography, graphic skills, style, and creativity.
* 5 maps about [terrain modeling](README.md#terrain-modeling)
and [hydrological modeling](README.md#hydrological-modeling)
* Layout and print all 5 maps on a 36"x72" plot
* Submit digital and print versions
