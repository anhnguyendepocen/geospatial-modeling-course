# Projects
The study landscape is a highly eroded watershed
feeding into Patterson Branch Creek in Fort Bragg, North Carolina.
This geomorphologically active watershed has deep gullies and
extensive areas of bare, exposed soils.
The creeks, streams, and rivers in this region are critical habitat
for endangered species of mussels.
Mussels, however, require stable stream habitat
and these actively eroding watersheds with sandy-loam soils
cause high sediment bed loads in streams and shifting streambeds.
The aim of this project is to restore the degraded watershed
and reduce sediment transport  
in order to enhance downstream mussel habitat.

## Geospatial modeling project
In order to understand the physical patterns and processes
that shape and change this landscape,
you will use lidar data to
model and digitally fabricate the topography,
analyze topographic parameters,
and simulate water and sediment flows.

In **groups of 5** complete the following assignments by **09/26**.
On 09/28 you will pin-up your work for a critique.
Upload digital copies of your work to the class network drive
at `\\desn-knox.lsu.edu\Landscape-Classes` on Windows
or `smb://desn-knox.lsu.edu/Landscape-Classes` on Mac.
Upload your GRASS mapsets, finished maps, perspectives, animations,
drawing for laser cutting, photos of your laser cut model,
and screenshots for the tutorials.

### Laser cut model
* Material: chipboard, museum board, or basswood (1/16" thick)
* Dimensions: 18"x18"
* Contour interval: 1m
* Hollow

### Tutorial
Complete the following sections of the tutorials on the course website.
Take screenshots to illustrate key steps in the tutorials.
* Screenshots for [Topographic analysis in GRASS GIS](README.md#topographic-analysis-in-grass-gis)
* Screenshots for [Hydrological modeling](README.md#hydrological-modeling)
* Screenshots for [Hydrological simulation](README.md#hydrological-simulation)

### Maps
Design 5 *beautiful* maps, perspectives, and/or animations
for our study landscape
using GRASS GIS and optionally Rhino
The maps should address topics covered in the
[terrain modeling](README.md#terrain-modeling)
and [hydrological modeling](README.md#hydrological-modeling)
modules of this course.
Include cartographic elements like legends, labels, scale bars, north arrows,
and cartographic grids.
Impress me with you cartography, graphic skills, style, and creativity.
* 5 maps about [terrain modeling](README.md#terrain-modeling)
and [hydrological modeling](README.md#hydrological-modeling)
* Layout and print all 5 maps on a 36"x72" plot
* Submit digital and print versions

## Generative design project
In **groups of 3**
you will use visual programming to generatively design
erosion control features to restore your degraded study landscape.
Through a series of algorithmically generated design interventions
you will explore interactions between
topographic form and hydrologic processes.
Your goal is to catalyze topographic changes that will
restore the landscape to a dynamic equilibrium.  
You will produce 3D printed models of your designs
and augment these with projected water flow and sediment flux.

### Screenshots
Complete the following tutorials
and take a screenshot of each completed task.
* Screenshots for [surface modeling](README.md#surface-modeling) **due: 10/10**.
* Screenshots for [parametric surface modeling](README.md#parametric-surface-modeling) **due: 10/17**.
* Screenshots for [attractors](README.md#attractors) **due: 10/24**.

### Exhibition design
Design the layout and setup of the final exhibition.
Then select and revise work from last project for the final exhibition.
* Exhibition concept **due: 10/12**
* Exhibition design **due: 10/26**
* Revised select work **due: 10/26**

### Families of form
You will design at least 6 different landforms
to control water and sediment flow.
For each landform make a 3D print, a 3D rendering,
and a water flow and erosion-deposition map.
* 6 4"x4" 3D prints **due: 10/26**
* 6 3D renderings **due: 10/26**
* 6 water and sediment flow maps **due: 10/26**

## Ecosystem modeling project
In **groups of 3** you will
map the existing vegetation
using automated image classification.
Then you will design, model, and render in 3D
a planting plan to restore this degraded landscape.
You will produce beautiful, photorealistic 3D renderings  
of the existing landscape and your design.

## Exhibition
As a class you will create an exhibition of your work.
* 3 36"x72" plots with maps analyzing the study landscape
* 3 18"x18" laser cut contour models augmented with projected maps and animations
* 30 4"x4" 3D prints
* 3 36"x72" plots with 3D renderings of the restored ecosystem
